# Edge Impulse Project Builder
This repository contains a shell script for creating either a library object or
a template mplab X project from an edge impulse C++ source code deployment. This
script should work for any xc32 supported platform.

Notes:
- This script has only been tested under linux, [Git Bash](https://gitforwindows.org/), and macOS.
- `*.options.ini` can be modified to set additional project options; for help
  call `prjMakefilesGenerator -setoptions=@ -help`
  + NB: all relative paths are considered relative to the project root folder
- `*.project.ini` is just a placeholder - the **languageToolchain** and **device**
  variables are replaced when building the project

## Software Used

2. Modify the following variables in build.sh or by setting environment variables:
