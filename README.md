# Edge Impulse Project Builder
This repository contains a shell script for creating either a library object or
a template mplab X project from an edge impulse C++ source code deployment. This
script should work for any xc32 supported platform.

Notes:
- This script has only been tested under linux and [Git Bash](https://gitforwindows.org/).
- options.ini can be modified to set additional project options; to see
  available project options call `prjMakefilesGenerator -setoptions=@ -help`
- project.ini is just a placeholder - the **languageToolchain*** and **device**
  variables are replaced when building the project
